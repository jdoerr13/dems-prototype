# DEMS Prototype (Phase I Frontend)

This is the Phase I frontend prototype for the Williamson County Digital Evidence Management System (DEMS).  
It provides role-based portals (LEA, Prosecutor, Defense, Admin) with dashboards, evidence upload, discovery, and audit logging.

# ðŸ”‘ Phase I Features

Role-based portals (LEA, Prosecutor, Defense, Admin)

Secure login flow (with MFA screen stubbed)

Audit trail + notifications (local mock, backend-ready)

Admin console (audit logs, notifications)




## DEMS Prototype â€“ Frontend Architecture (Phase I)
This React + Vite + Tailwind frontend implements the Digital Evidence Management System (DEMS) prototype.
It is designed to be role-based (LEA, Prosecutor, Defense, Admin) with dashboards, evidence upload, discovery, audit trails, and notifications.
 
Top-Level Files
â€¢	vite.config.js, tailwind.config.js, postcss.config.js
Frontend build + styling configs (Vite + Tailwind).
â€¢	package.json
Lists dependencies (React, react-router, react-hot-toast, recharts, etc).
â€¢	index.html
Entry HTML file served by Vite.
 
Entry Point
â€¢	src/main.jsx
Boots the React app. Wraps everything in <BrowserRouter> and context providers.
â€¢	src/App.jsx
Central router.
Defines Routes â†’ directs to portals, dashboards, or stub pages based on user role.
Wraps routes in ProtectedRoute or PublicLayout.
 
Contexts (Global State)
â€¢	contexts/AuthContext.jsx
Manages authentication state (login/logout, current user).
Currently runs off mock users from mock/data.js.
Backend will replace mock with real /api/login and /api/mfa.
â€¢	contexts/RoleContext.jsx
Tracks which role is active (LEA, Prosecutor, Defense, Admin).
Used to control sidebar navigation and portal access.
â€¢	contexts/CaseContext.jsx
Central state for cases, evidence, audits, notifications.
Functions include:
o	addCase, addEvidence â†’ add records + fire notifications.
o	acceptCase, assignDefense, linkCoDefendant â†’ case workflows.
o	addAudit, notify, markAllRead.
Frontend-ready to call backend endpoints later.
 
Components (Shared UI)
â€¢	Layout.jsx
Main shell: sidebar navigation, notification bell + dropdown, and logout.
Uses contexts to render role-specific navigation.
â€¢	PublicLayout.jsx
Simplified layout for public pages (login, transparency logs).
â€¢	ProtectedRoute.jsx
Guards routes â†’ redirects unauthenticated users to /login.
â€¢	AuditTrail.jsx
Displays chronological audit events.
â€¢	EvidenceUpload.jsx
Upload component. Currently pushes files into CaseContext.
Backend integration will forward files â†’ S3/Supabase.
â€¢	EvidenceViewer.jsx
Displays evidence inline (video, image, PDF/doc placeholders).
When backend returns real file URLs, Viewer renders directly.
 
Hooks
â€¢	hooks/useDashboardData.js
Collects counts and summary metrics for dashboards.
Pulls from CaseContext. Used in LEA, Prosecutor, Defense, and Admin dashboards.
 
Mock Data
â€¢	mock/data.js
Seed dataset for demo.
Includes:
o	initialCases (case objects with status, officers, assignments)
o	initialEvidence (files with type/URL stubs)
o	initialAudits (audit logs)
o	initialNotifications
This makes the frontend fully demo-able without a backend.
 
Pages
Core Role Portals
â€¢	LEAPortal.jsx â†’ Law Enforcement upload portal. Case/evidence entry.
â€¢	ProsecutorPortal.jsx â†’ Case management, approvals, assign defense, link co-defendants.
â€¢	DefensePortal.jsx â†’ Discovery portal, read-only access to assigned evidence.
â€¢	AdminConsole.jsx â†’ Admin management (users, audits, settings).
Dashboards
â€¢	LEADashboard.jsx â†’ Case counts, evidence breakdown, custody events.
â€¢	ProsecutorDashboard.jsx â†’ Pending approvals, discovery evidence, toast alerts.
â€¢	DefenseDashboard.jsx â†’ Assigned cases, evidence list, toast alerts.
â€¢	AdminConsoleDashboard.jsx â†’ Case stats, audit logs, notifications, CSV export stub.
Auth
â€¢	Login.jsx â†’ Login screen. Currently mock auth, backend-ready.
â€¢	MFA.jsx â†’ MFA challenge screen (stubbed, ready to connect).
Phase II / III Stubs
Located in pages/stubs/.
Each one represents a roadmap feature that can be demoed but not yet integrated:
â€¢	AdvancedAudit.jsx (Phase II reporting)
â€¢	BulkUpload.jsx
â€¢	ChainOfCustody.jsx
â€¢	CoDefendants.jsx
â€¢	DefenseDelegation.jsx
â€¢	Analytics.jsx
â€¢	Redaction.jsx
â€¢	CrossAgency.jsx
â€¢	Archival.jsx
â€¢	TransparencyLogs.jsx / TransparencyLogsInternal.jsx
â€¢	UserManagement.jsx
â€¢	Integrations.jsx, Onboarding.jsx, PublicPortal.jsx
